# FAQ

## Is TIR “AI”?
No. The standard is deterministic and explainable. Implementations may choose to add assistive tools, but TIR-STD does not require AI.

## Is this legal advice?
No. TIR provides structured references. Users must verify against primary sources and professional advice.

## Why “Registry”?
Because TIR registers structured rule packs and returns structured references; it is not an authority or enforcement mechanism.

## Why open source?
Because transaction framing is foundational infrastructure and must be auditable and publicly reviewable.
