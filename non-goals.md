# Non-goals

TIR is intentionally constrained.

TIR will not:
- provide legal/tax/investment advice
- issue binding compliance determinations
- execute payments, signatures, or filings
- replace professional judgment
- ingest or store real personal identity documents in this open repository

TIR will:
- standardise intent representation
- surface applicable considerations via rule packs
- provide explainable sequencing and checklists
- produce a traceable TIR Record
