# Contributing

TIR is an open standard and optional reference implementation.

## What to contribute
- Spec improvements (`spec/`): schema clarity, semantics, versioning rules
- Documentation (`docs/`): adoption guides, FAQs, comparisons
- Reference implementation fixes (`reference/`): usability and determinism improvements
- Example rule packs and intents (`examples/`): illustrative, non-advisory samples

## Constraints (must follow)
- Do not add legal/tax/investment advice.
- Do not add interpretive statements that can be construed as determinations.
- Do not submit real personal or confidential data.
- All rule packs must include provenance metadata and “illustrative-only” flags where applicable.

## Process
1. Open an issue describing the change.
2. Submit a PR referencing the issue.
3. Maintainers review for neutrality, clarity, and backwards compatibility.

## Versioning
Spec changes follow semantic versioning (see `spec/versioning.md`).
